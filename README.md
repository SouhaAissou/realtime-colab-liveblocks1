## Project Overview

This project uses a robust stack to provide real-time document collaboration capabilities, allowing multiple users to edit the same document simultaneously with live feedback. The key technologies used include:

- **Liveblocks** for live updates and real-time synchronization.
- **Next.js** as the frontend framework for fast, server-side rendered pages.
- **Supabase** for user authentication, database, and real-time data handling.
- **Shadcn UI** for high-quality, customizable components.

## Key Features

### Shared Document Editing
- Real-time document editing powered by **Liveblocks**.
- Collaborative cursor tracking for an enhanced user experience.

### User Presence Indicators
- Real-time indicators display active users in the document, making it easy to track collaborators.

### User Authentication and Ownership
- **Supabase** handles user authentication and document ownership, securing access to each document.
